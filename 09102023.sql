Explanation: 
Customer with id = 23 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 12.
Customer with id = 9 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 13.
Customer with id = 30 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
Customer with id = 54 visited the mall three times. During 2 visits they did not make any transactions, and during one visit they made 3 transactions.
Customer with id = 96 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
As we can see, users with IDs 30 and 96 visited the mall one time without making any transactions. Also, user 54 visited the mall twice and did not make any transactions.

/*
 Two tables. One containing a customer ID and a unique visit ID. Customers with multiple visits will have their customer ID appear multiple times. And a transaction table, if a transaction exists then it'll appear here with the visit_id
 Return the costumer IDs and the amount of visits they made that does not appear in the transaction table.

 Use the join keyword to combine the two tables.
